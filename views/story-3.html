          <h2>How to Start a Coffee Brand</h2>
          <p>
            So you want to start a coffee brand—welcome to the world of coffee
            entrepreneurs! We are a world of eccentric and wonderful people who
            are all convinced that the struggle and challenges of owning our own
            businesses are worthwhile, because we love coffee and we love coffee
            people
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to sell coffee, you need a coffee brand. Now, this brand
            can be simple or it can be complex—but you will only succeed with
            your new coffee business if you intentionally create your brand and
            perform outreach in a cohesive way. Luckily the process isn’t too
            complex, and you can differentiate yourself simply by working to
            present your coffees well to your ideal customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would argue that business success comes from intentionally
            fulfilling your promises (both spoken and implied) to your
            customers, over and over and over. It’s that simple. However, I
            would guess that if you think about any successful business, you can
            identify the promises they are making and keeping. In order to
            fulfill your promises, you need to know what you’re promising, and
            in order to do that, you must know who you are as a business.
          </p>

        <section class="main-content">
          <div class="paragraph-card">
            <h3>Who Are You?</h3>
            <p>
              We humans like new things! There’s a reason that every time big
              tech companies release a new product, people line up and camp out
              the night before, even if they already have a similar product. In
              the coffee world, we see this with pumpkin spice lattes, limited
              releases, and cool collabs. Don’t you get excited when your
              favorite roasting company does something new? There’s almost no
              limit to how excited we get over new things, which means that the
              more new things you as a coffee business offer, the more your
              customers will buy.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph-card">
            <h3>Simple Statistics</h3>
            <p>
              I always argue that if you do it well, marketing—creating a brand
              and using targeted outreach to connect with your ideal
              customers—is a true expression of who you are as a business owner
              and the aspects you choose to share; thus, it is one of the most
              authentic things you can do as a human. To actively engage people,
              you need to be clear on who you are and how that is conveyed in
              the business.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example: any brand I lead will have to be an earnest,
              story-driven, ethical one. My coffee importing company, Catalyst
              Trade, doesn’t spend much on branding or marketing, but we are
              proud to have an intensely connected group of coffee roasters who
              buy our traceable Ethiopian coffees because of our ethical and
              responsible focus. Plus, the coffees are great!
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="paragraph-card">
            <h3>Who Do You Want to Reach?</h3>
            <p>
              Again, many new coffee business owners overlook that they are
              going to be (hopefully) selling their product to actual people
              with likes and dislikes, and that these people may be overwhelmed
              so they will default to the most clear branding. Trying to sell to
              everyone is the best way to sell to no one. You will treat your
              brand differently if you’re reaching art students than if you’re
              marketing to modern offices. Make sure that the demographic you
              are aiming at actually has the money to buy your coffee, then
              really dig in to learn what they look for when purchasing
              anything. Those learnings will apply to your coffee. You will want
              to find a sweet spot where the identity of your brand dovetails
              with your customers’. Onyx Coffee Lab is a fantastic example; so
              is Starbucks. Look at your competitors, evaluate who they are
              reaching and how well they are doing it, and use that information
              to inform your own approach.takes time to build.

            <h3>What You Will Need</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic Branding.</strong>Even if you do it yourself on
                Canva.com or have your artist nephew try his hand, you need a
                basic visual brand. This should include a logo, chosen colors
                and fonts, and maybe some supplementary graphics. You can spend
                $500 on this or you can spend $20,000, depending on the
                direction you take. I always lean toward just getting something
                and running with it, improving later once the business is making
                money, but this is personal preference. The important thing is
                to make sure your branding continues to deliver on your
                promises, identity, and customer fit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Basic Copy. </strong> So many business owners overlook
                how the words on their websites, social media profiles, emails,
                and printed collateral (including coffee bags) impact the
                customer perception. You don’t have to hire a pro copywriter to
                do this for you, but definitely make sure that the spirit of
                your brand is conveyed in every location and that you have
                someone read it all to catch typos.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A Website.</strong> It’s (nearly) 2021: you need a
                website. You can have a simple landing page that points people
                to your email list or you can have e-commerce, but you have to
                have a website where people can find you. Squarespace and
                WordPress are both great options for easy DIY sites. WooCommerce
                and Shopify are both very common options for selling your coffee
                through your website.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A Decision About Social Media. </strong>You don’t have
                to use social media for your business, but you do need ways to
                reach your customers. And if you do use social media, you need
                to really weigh the benefits vs. the effort (ROI) because many
                social networks, like Twitter, are not the best use of time for
                most coffee businesses. Instagram is tough to convert, while
                Facebook ads can be successful with certain demographics. So do
                your research and don’t use social media just because you have
                to.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>An Email List. </strong>Don’t neglect this! Your email
                list is one of the only customer channels that you can own,
                where your customers have chosen to have you in their lives, and
                can have very high sales conversion. I cover this in a lot more
                detail during my Coffee Marketing Masterclass, but like most
                things, it’s simple: show up in their inboxes and be
                interesting.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A Plan for Outreach.</strong> Once you have all these
                pieces in place, you will need to create a reasonable plan to
                reach your customers. This should look different for every
                business and should be tailored to your customers, whether it is
                dropping off samples at offices or starting a partnership with a
                local food cart to refer customers to each other. The point is
                to have a plan, work it, and then observe and adjust as needed.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Starting a new coffee brand isn’t exactly easy, but it is entirely
              doable. I hope that you have an enormous amount of success!

            <h3>Important Metrics</h3>
            <p>
              Even if you’re not data-driven, you should still track your
              results from your offers so that you can improve with each one. At
              a minimum, I recommend you keep track of the ways you promoted the
              offer, any responses you got from customers, and your final number
              of sales. If you care to track results for each channel (e.g.
              email vs. in-person sales), then it is even more educational.
            </p>
